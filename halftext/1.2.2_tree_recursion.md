## 1.2.2

Anogher common pattern of computation is called *tree recursion*. As as example, consider computing the seqeunce of Fibonacci number in which each number is the sum of preceding two:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 21, ....

In general, the Fibonacci numbers can be dedined by the rule

```
          | 0 if n = 0,
Fib(n) = <  1 if n = 1,
          | Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2) otherwise.

```

We can immediately translate this definition into a recuresive procedure of computing Fibonacci numbers:

```Lisp
(define (fib n)
    (cond ((= n 0) 0)
    ((= n 1) 1)
    (else (+ (fib (- n 1)) 
            (fib (- n 2))))
    ))
```

Consider the pattern of this computation. To compute `(fib 5)`, we compute `(fib 4)` and `(fib 3)`. To compute `(fib 4)`, we compute `(fib 3)` and `(fib 2)`. In general, the evolved process looks like a tree, as show in `Figure 1.5`.  Notice that the branches split into two at each level (except at the bottom); this reflects the fact that the `fib` prcedure calls itself twice each time it is invoked.

This procedure is instructive as a prototypical tree recursion, but it is a terrible way to compute Fibonacci numbers because it does so mach redundant computation. Notice in Figure 1.5 that the entire computation of `(fib 3)` - almost a half the work - is dublicated. In fact, it is not hard to show that the number of times the procedure will compute `(fib 1)` or `(fib 0)` 9the number of leaves in the above tree, in general0 is precisely `Fib(n+1)`. To get an idea of how bad this is, one can show that the valude of `Fib(b)` growsn exmpnentially with `n`.M More preciselty (see Excercise 1.13), Fib(n) is the closest integer to `fi**2/sqrt(5)`.

```Ruby
fi = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 == 1.6180
```
is the *golden ration*, which satisfies the quation

```Ruby
fi*fi = fi + 1
```

This, the process uses a number of steps that grows exponentially with input. On the other hand, the space required grows only linearly with the input, because we need keep track only of which nodes are abouve us in tree at any point if the computation. In general, the number of steps required by a tree-recursive process will be proportional to the number of nodes in the tree, while the space will be proportional to the maximum depth of the tree.


We can also formulate an itarative process for computing the Fibonacci numbers. The idea is to use a pair of integers `a` and `b`, initiallize to `Fib(1) = 1` and `Fib(0) = 0`, and to repeatedly apply the simultaneous transofrmations

```
a <-- a + b
b <-- a
````

It is not hard to show that, after applying this transofmration `n` times, `a` and `b` will be equal, respectively to `Fib(n+1)` and `Fib(n)`. Thus we can compute Fibonacci numbers iteratively using the procedure

```Lisp
    (define (fib n)
        (fib-iter 1 0 n))
    (define (fib-iter a b count)
        (if (= count 0)
            b
            (fib-iter (+ a b) a (- count 1)))    
    ) 
```

This second method for computing `Fib(n)` is a linear iteration. The difference in number of steps required by the two medhos - on linear in `n`, one grows as fast as `Fib(n)` itself - is enormous, even for small inputs.

One should not conclude from this that tree-recursive porcesses are useless. When we consider processes that operate on hierarchically structured data rather tan numbers, we will find that tree recuresion is a natural and powerful tool. *(32)*

> *(32)* An example of this was hinted at in Section 1.13. The interpreter itself evaluates expressions using a tree-recursive process.

But even in numerical operations, tree-recusive processes can be usefull in helpoing us to understand and design programs. For instance, althought the fist `fib` procedure is much less efficeint than the second one, it is more strightforward, being little more than a translation into Lisp of the definithion of the Fibonacci secuence. To formulate the iterative algorithm required noticing that the computation could be recast as an iteration with three state variables.
