## Procedures as Black-Box Abstractions.

`sqrt` is our first example of a process defined by a sen of mutually definded prcedures. Notice that the definition of `sqrt-iter` is *recursive*; that is, the procedure is defined in terms of itself. The idea of being able to define a procedure in terms of itself my be disturbing; in may seem unclear how such a "circular" definition coud make sence at all, much less specify a well-defined process to be carried out by a computer. This will be addressed more carefully in **Section 1.2.**. But first let's consider some other important points illustrated by the `sqrt` example.

#### Figure 1.2: Procedural decomposition of the sqrt program.

Observer that the proglem of computing square roots breaks up naturally into a number of subproblems: how to tell wheter a guess is good enought, how to improve a guess, and so on. Each of these tasks is accomplished by a separate procedure. The tntire `sqrt` program can be viewed as a cluster of procetures (show in **Figure 1.2**) that mirror the decompostion of the proglem into subproblems.

The importance of this decomposition strategy is not simply that one si dividing the program into parts. After all, we could take any large program and divide it into parts - te first ten lines, the next ten lines, then next ten lines, ans so on. Rather, it is crucial that each procedure accomplishes an identifiable task that can be used as module in defining other procedures. For example, when we define the `good-ehough?` procedure in terms of `square`, we able to regard the `square` procedure as a "black box". We are not at that momen concerned with *how* the procedure computes its result, only with the fact that it computes the square. The details of how the square is computed can e suppressed, to be considered at a latter time. Indeed, as far as the `good-enought?` procedure is concerned, `square` is not quite a procedure but rather an abstraction of a procedure, a so-called *precedureal abastraction*. At this level of abstraction, any procedure that computes the square is equally good.

This, considering only the values thay return, the following two procedures for squaring a number should be indistinguishable. Each takes a numberical argument and produces the square for that numbe as the value.

```Lisp
(define (square x) (* x x))
(define (square x)(exp (double (log x))))
(define (double x) (+ x x))
```

So a pocudure definition shuold be able to suppress detail. The useds of the procedure man not have written the procedure themselves, but may have obtained it from anogher programmer as a black box. A user shuold no need  to know how the procedure is implemented in order ot use it.
