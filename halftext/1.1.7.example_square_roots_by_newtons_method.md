# 1.1.7 Example: Square Roots by Newton's Method.

Procedures, as intorduced above, are much like oridnary mathematical functions. They specify a value that is determined by one ore more paramenters. But there is an important differeence between mathematica functions and computer procedures. Procedures must be effective.

As a case in point, consider the problem of computing square roots. We can define the square-root functions as

`sqrt(x) = the y such that y >=0 and y*2 == x`

This describes a perfectly legitimate mathematical function. We could use it to recognize whether one number is the squrare root of another, or to derive fact about square roots in general. On the other hand, the definition does not describe a procedure. Indeed, it tells us almost nothing about how to actually find the square root of a given number. It will not help matters of peharase this definition in pseudo-Lisp:

```lisp
(deifne (sqrt x)
(the y (and (>= y0) (= (square y) x))s))
```

This only begs the question.

The contrast between function ad procedure is a reflection of the general distincion betweeen describing properites of things and describing how to do things, or, as iti t sometimes reffered to, the distinction between declarative knowledge and imperative knowledge. In mathematics we are usually concerned with declarative (what is) descriptions, whereas in computer science we are usully concerned with imperative (how to) descriptions.
