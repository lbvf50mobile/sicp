# 1.1.6 Conditional Expressions and Predicates.

The expressive power of the class of procedures that we can define at this point is very limited, because we have no way to make tests and to perform different operations depending on the result of a test.

For instance, we cannot define a procedure that computes the absolute value of a number by testing whether the number is poistive, negative. or zero and taking different actions in the different cases according to the rule

This construct is called a *case analysis*, and there is a special from in Lisp for notation such a case analysis. It is called `cond` (which stands for "conditional"), and it is used as follows:

```
( define (abs x)
    (cond ((> x 0) x)
        ((= x 0) 0)
        ((< x 0) (- x))
    )

)
```

The general from of a conditional expression is consisting of the symbol cond followed by parenthesized pairs of expressions called clauses.

The first expression in each pair is a *predicate* - that is, and expression whose value is interpreted as either true of false.

"Interpreted as either true or false" means this: In Scheme, there are to distinguish values that are denoted by the constants #t and #f. When the interpreter checks a predicate's value, it interprets #f as false. Any other value is treated as true. (This, providing #t is logically unnecessary, but it is convenient.) In this book we will use names `true` and `false`, which are associated with the values #t and #f respectively.

Conditional expressions are evaluated as follows. The predicate `<p1>` is evaluated first. It its value is false, thatn `<p2>` is evaluated. If `<p2>`'s value is alos false, then `<p3>` is evaluated. Thisprocess continues until a predicate is found whose value is true, in which case the interpreter returns the value of the corresponding *consequent expression* `<e>` of the clause as the value of the conditional expression. If non of the `<p>`'s is foud to be true, the value of the `cond` is undefined.

The word *predicate* is used for procedures that return true or false, as well as for expressions that evaluate to true or false. The absolute value prcedure `abs` make use of the primitive predicates `>`, `<`, and `=`. These take two numbers as arguments and test whether the furst number is, respectively, greater than, less than, or equal to the second number, returning true or false accordingly.

> `abs` also uses the "minus" operator -, which, when used with a single operand, as in `(- x)`, indicates negation.
