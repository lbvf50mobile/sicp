# 1.1.6 Conditional Expressions and Predicates.

The expressive power of the class of procedures that we can define at this point is very limited, because we have no way to make tests and to perform different operations depending on the result of a test.

For instance, we cannot define a procedure that computes the absolute value of a number by testing whether the number is poistive, negative. or zero and taking different actions in the different cases according to the rule

This construct is called a *case analysis*, and there is a special from in Lisp for notation such a case analysis. It is called `cond` (which stands for "conditional"), and it is used as follows:

```
( define (abs x)
    (cond ((> x 0) x)
        ((= x 0) 0)
        ((< x 0) (- x))
    )

)
```

The general from of a conditional expression is consisting of the symbol cond followed by parenthesized pairs of expressions called clauses.

The first expression in each pair is a *predicate* - that is, and expression whose value is interpreted as either true of false.
