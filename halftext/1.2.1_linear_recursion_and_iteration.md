## 1.2.1 Linear Recursion and Iteration

We begin by considering the factorial function, defined by

`n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) *** 3 * 2 * 2`

There are many ways to compute factorials. One way is to make use of the observation that `n!` is equal to `n` times `(n-1)!` for any positiveinteger `n`:

`n! = n * [(n-1) * (n-2) ... * 3 * 2 * 1] = n * (n-1)!`

Thus, we can compute `n!` by computing `(n-1)!` and multiplying the result by `n`. If we add the stipulation of that `1!` is egual to `1`, this observation translates directly into a procedure:

```Lisp
(define (factorial n)
 (if (= n 1)
    1
 (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
 ```
