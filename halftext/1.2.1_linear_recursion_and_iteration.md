## 1.2.1 Linear Recursion and Iteration

We begin by considering the factorial function, defined by

`n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) *** 3 * 2 * 2`

There are many ways to compute factorials. One way is to make use of the observation that `n!` is equal to `n` times `(n-1)!` for any positiveinteger `n`:

`n! = n * [(n-1) * (n-2) ... * 3 * 2 * 1] = n * (n-1)!`

Thus, we can compute `n!` by computing `(n-1)!` and multiplying the result by `n`. If we add the stipulation of that `1!` is egual to `1`, this observation translates directly into a procedure:

```Lisp
(define (factorial n)
 (if (= n 1)
    1
 (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
 ```

 ```Lisp
 (factorial 6) ------------------------------------
 (* 6 (factorial 5))                               |
 (* 6 (* 5 (factorial 4)))                         |
 (* 6 (* 5 (* 4 (factorial 3))))                   |
 (* 6 (* 5 (* 4 (* 3 (factorial 2)))))             |
 (* 6 (* 5 (* 4 (* 3 (* 2 (facorial 1))))))        |
 (* 6 (* 5 (* 4 (* 3 (* 2 1)))))                   |
 (* 6 (* 5 (* 4 (* 3 2))))                         |
 (* 6 (* 5 (* 4 6)))                               |
 (* 6 (* 5 24))                                    |
 (* 6 120)                                         |

 ```
**Figure 1.3:** A linear recursion process for computing 6!

 We can use the subsitution model of  [Section 1.1.5](1.1.5_the_substitution_model_for_proceducre_application.md) to watch this procedure in action computing `6!`, as shown in Figure 1.3.

 Now let's take a different perspecitve on comuting factorials. We could describe a rule for computing `n!` by specifying that we first multiply 1 by 2, than multiply the result by 3, than by 4, ans so on untill we reach `n`. More formally, we maintain a running product, together with a counter that count from 1 up to `n`. We can describe the computation by saying that the counter and the product simultaneously change from one step to the next according to the rule

 ```
 product <= counter * product
 counter <= counter + 1
 ```

 and stipulating than `n!` is the value of the product when the counter exceeds `n`.

 Once again, we can recast our description as a procdure for computing factorials: *(29)*

 > *(29)* In a real program we would probably use the block structure introduced in the last section to hide the definition of `fact-iter`:

 ```Lisp
 (define (factorial n)
    (define (iter product counter)
        (if (> counter n)
            product
            (iter (* counter product)
            (+ counter 1))))
 (iter 1 1))
 ```
 > We avoided doing this here so as to minimize the number of thing to think about a once.

 ```
 (factorial 6) --------------
 (fact-iter 1 1 6)          |
 (fact-iter 1 2 6)          |
 (fact-iter 2 3 6)          |
 (fact-iter 6 4 6)          |
 (fact-iter 24 5 6)         |
 (fact-iter  120 6 6)       |
 (fact-iter 720 7 6)        |
 720 <-----------------------
 ```

 **Figrue 1.4:** A linear iterative process for computing 6!.


 ```Lisp
 (define (factorial n) 
    (fact-iter 1 1 n))
(define (fact-iter product counter max-count)
(if (> counter max-count)
    product
    (fact-iter (* counter product)
            (+ counter 1)
        max-count)))
 ```

 As befro, we can use the substutution model to visualize the process of computing `6!`, as show in Figure 1.4.
